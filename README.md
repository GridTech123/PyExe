#How to use
`NOTE: Do this in the directory of all your files` <br>
step 1 import: `import PyExe`<br>
step 2 run: `PyExe.build('pythonfile', 'exeName', '1.0.0', ['pygame','time'], ['hi.png','bye.wav'])`<br>

-Lets break down what that does <br>
~`PyExe.build` runs the build <br>
~`'pythonfile'` tells the program what file to turn into an exe, this is a string and you don't add the .py file extension <br>
~`'exeName'` is what you want to call the exe <br>
~`'1.0.0'` is the version of your build <br>
~`['pygame','time']` are the modules to include in your build <br>
~`['hi.png','bye.wav']` are the files to include in your build

-If it does not build automatically: <br>
~Open command prompt to the directory of your build <br>
~enter the name of your file_pyExe.py build <br>
~click enter

#Installation <br>
Put PyExe.py in c:/python27/lib
